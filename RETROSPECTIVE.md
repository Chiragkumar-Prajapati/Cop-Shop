# Team Retrospective

As part of the transition of completing work on the second iteration of the project and beginning 
work on the third, the team assembled to perform a retrospect. During this process, the team went 
over both the successes and areas of improvement based on the second iteration. The major success
that the team members had was with the work load distribution process for the project. The workloads
themselves were sometimes uneven, so members didn't amounts of work weren't necessarily the same. 
The most important area of improvement the team agreed was communication amongst its members.

The first proposed solution towards this was the addition of a 'logging' channel on the team 
communication tool used (Slack). The idea was to have members report their progress on the issues
being worked on more frequently on that channel. The logging aspect came in that members didn't
have to provide progress updates with high levels of detail. This pseudo-casual manner would encourage
more frequent communication. Another goal that this was meant to achieve was to have all members
kept up to date by having a most complete possible picture of current work progress. This eliminates
duplicate efforts and the completely missing of certain tasks due to ambiguity as to who was assigned 
to do it. 

To tackle the issue of uneven work loads, the team members decided that upcoming issues should have
an increased level of granularity and larger issues be broken down as required. The original division
of the workload based on features proved to be faulty since the features themselves and the work required
to implement them was uneven. By having the issues be of roughly equal size, division by number of issues
would not be as uneven as the original distribution. The potential improved communication tied in as well
to this in that, workload would be evened out by communication of much was getting done by each member.

Methods of evaluation of the success of these solutions was also discussed as part of the meeting. Since
the root are of improvement was communication and workload distribution, it was appropriate the measurement
of success criteria revolve around this. To measure the effectiveness of the logging channel, we would
measure the number of updates each member posted on a daily basis to the channel. If the average number of 
updates each member posted daily was more than five, the solution would be considered successful. For the
granularization of issues, if the actual number of hours completed by each member was within five hours 
discrepancy from the average, this solution would also be considered successful.
