# Team Retrospective

As part of the transition from the second iteration to the third iteration, we assembled to perform 
a retrospective. During this process, we went over both successes and potential areas of improvement 
from the second iteration. A major success we had was in the way we distributed workloads between 
team members. Tasks were delegated efficiently and everyone had something to do. However, the 
workloads themselves were sometimes uneven, so despite our work distribution, some of us needed to 
do more or less work than others in the same amount of time, leading to some team members feeling 
like they weren’t contributing enough. Due to this, we agreed that our most important area of 
improvement was with communication.

The first proposed solution towards this was the addition of a “progress logging” channel on our 
Slack workspace. The idea was to have members periodically report progress on their current task, 
so they could find something that still needed to be done when they finished. Everyone was aware 
of what was being worked on, so efforts weren’t being duplicated. Progress updates posted in Slack 
also did not have to be in as much detail as a merge request or commit. This casual manner 
encouraged more frequent progress updates, which helped keep everyone up to date on the current 
state of the project, improving our confidence in being able to meet our deadlines.

To tackle the issue of uneven workloads, we decided that larger tasks, including user stories, 
should be broken down even further than we had done initially. Our original plan to divide tasks 
amongst ourselves based on features proved to be faulty, as the work required to implement each 
feature was rather uneven. The issue of unevenly divided work was addressed by breaking our issues 
down further until they were of a more equal size and dividing work by groupings of issues instead 
of entire features. 

Methods to evaluate the success of these solutions were also discussed. Since the root area of 
improvement was communication and workload distribution, it was appropriate that the measurement of 
success revolve around this. To measure the effectiveness of the progress logging channel, we would 
measure the number of updates each member posted on a daily basis to the channel. If the average 
number of updates each member posted weekly was more than ten, and we experienced no work 
duplication, the solution would be considered successful. For the granularization of issues, 
if the actual number of hours completed by each member was within five hours discrepancy from the 
total average, this solution would also be considered successful.
