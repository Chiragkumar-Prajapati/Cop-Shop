# Vision statement

CopShop will be an auctioning platform that police precincts can use to raise funds by selling off 
impounded items to members of the local public. 

The application is designed to be used by police precincts to conduct public auctions for 
property they’ve impounded. Precincts can list items to be auctioned and specify when auctions 
should begin and end. They can also choose to list an item with no set auction date. The details 
for these listings such as the description, price and location can be modified at any time. 

Members of the local public will use the application to bid on items that precincts have listed to 
be auctioned off. They can search for items available for auction through criteria that includes 
specifying precincts as well as detailed categories. They can view a summary of their bids with 
information regarding when auctions are ending as well as whether or not they’ve been outbid. 
When an individual wins an item in an auction, they are notified that they must come to the 
precinct in order to complete their payment and collect their item.

CopShop provides police precincts with a quick and easy way to sell unclaimed property back to 
the community as well as buyers across the country. Items no longer need to occupy storage 
space for long periods of time until annual auctions, which are often poorly attended and 
therefore result in minimal revenue. Instead, through the application, they will be accessible 
online at any time. This has the potential to bring in more buyers and drive bids higher which will 
consequently result in more revenue generation for the participating police precincts. 

People looking for good deals on used equipment and other property, as well as those 
searching for hard-to-find items both benefit from the convenience and location-independence 
of the mobile application over conventional silent auctions or sell-offs.

CopShop also increases communication and cooperation between the police station and the 
community, by providing a time efficient way for police stations to return lost or stolen items. 
Owners of missing property can browse the list of items queued for auction and easily see if 
their belongings have been found, saving owners and officers time by eliminating phone calls 
and unnecessary visits to the police station.

The project will be considered successful if it shows superiority over traditional police auctions in 
the following comparisons. Firstly, police precincts that utilize the app will be surveyed on 
whether or not they prefer to use the application over their former method of selling or disposing 
of impounded property. Secondly, the number of people viewing and bidding on items will be 
compared to the numbers from previous auctions. Finally, the funds raised from the sale of 
items through the application will be compared to funds raised before the its utilization.
