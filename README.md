### Purpose:
CopShop is a mobile application aimed to facilitate the buying and selling of impounded items, and return lost items to members of the local public. This provides the benefits of reduced storage strain for all precincts involved, as well as the ability to raise funds for use by the facility. Users seeking to purchase items will be able to make bids on items over a set duration of time, with the item going to the highest bidder. This format enables precincts to clear out impounded items within a short time period while also reducing the manpower needed in the process.
